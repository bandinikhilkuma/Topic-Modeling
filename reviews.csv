140,Best camera phone under 30k. After software update heating and battery draining issue was 70% solved
141,"The phone is fully functional and meets all expectations. I'm fully satisfied with it, especially the night photography. 📸✨ However, there's a heating issue that I think is due to the Exynos processor.
One suggestion: If you're planning to get an S23 FE, I'd recommend waiting a few months for the Snapdragon version. It'll be worth the wait!"
142,"Overall, good phone except the heating issues"
143,"This mobile device is experiencing an elevated temperature, reaching approximately 44 degrees Celsius, even with limited usage, such as watching a five-minute video. Regrettably, there appears to be a lack of adequate support from Flipkart in addressing this issue. Consequently, I can not recommend this product based on the aforementioned concerns."

The phone is a bit on the heavier side but mainly due to the metal parts and battery. It feels top notch premium, and performs buttery smooth (Note: it's slippery as it has glass on both sides so it's a good idea to have a case ready for it when it comes).

193,"After using the Samsung S23 FE for around 15 days, I've compiled my thoughts on its various aspects.

Performance and Value:
Priced at under 40k (256GB), the Samsung S23 FE stands out as one of the best options in its price range. However, it's essential to note that no mobile device is without its drawbacks.

Durability:
One notable downside is its tendency to overheat, especially during outdoor use. This issue can be quite frustrating, akin to holding a hot pan.

Camera Performance:

My usage is very minimal, no games at all, might take 2-3 photos in a day if required. Still battery does not last for a day. Batter to go with other phones. Same is the issue with S23 with 3900 mAh battery. Samsung should consider this."

It has a premium look and feel, and the sound quality is excellent. Performance-wise, it handles tasks efficiently and smoothly.

297,"It’s my first iPhone ever and I bought it with my earned money through part time jobs in college✌️

I am a tech freak so you can trust my views -
- A14 Bionic is the fastest, most efficient and reliable processor till date
- The camera focuses so quickly that you can take DSLR quality photos.
- The screen size 6.1 inches is the most comfortable screen size out there and the OLED retina XDR display is so crisp and everything feels real.
- The stereo speakers are so clear even on high volume an..."
298,"This was an awesome buy. I bought this phone for my father who was upgrading from an iPhone 6. He is very happy with this phone. The size is really good. He said that it was even more comfortable to hold than the 6 as it had flat sides. It is Smaller than most android phones but big enough for anything and everything.

The performance is Stellar. You won't notice any lag and it's very fast. Ram management is good too. And the phone stays at a reasonable temperature even when using Gmaps.

Performance is also good"
302,"It is my first iphone bought in bbd sale. Acc to me it is most value for money compare to others phone, everything is good display,sound,performance,everything except battery which is average acc to me. I charged my iphone 12 with 20W charger when my battery comes down to 40% and remove it from charging when it reaches to 80%. It takes about 30 min to charge it. My battery heath is still 100% acc to me which is good👍👍
Here are some samples taken by me in iphone12🥰"

314,"Nothing to say about this device. Absolutely flawless. Premium in-hand feel. Nothing to say about the camera. Surround sound works absolutely fine. A14 Bionic is just flawless. Smooth multi tasking. This is my first big upgrade to any flagship device and the usage is mesmerizing. Im literally impressed. Used 5s and 6s years ago, but nothing comes infront of this! Can blindly go for this device. Kudos to Flipkart and their next day delivery policy. Open box policy is also impressive. Go for it."

319,"iPhone 6S Plus 64GB -> iPhone 12 128GB
My 2nd iPhone, upgraded after 5 years.

Gorgeous display, stunning new blue colour, excellent camera, best hardware-software combination, that’s how I would describe iPhone 12 as a package. 😊

Even though my previous iPhone had a 5.5” display and this one has 6.1” display, its overall body size is much smaller. Had to get used to it initially 🙂

Opening/closing/loading of apps is fast. No issues there. Video playback on this screen looks gorgeous. Took..."

325,"Switched from Android to iPhone and this transition was really smooth due to its easier GUI. I bought this 128 Gb variant and Didn’t waited for iPhone 13 as iPhone 12 has all ,what one need in a perfect phone. In person white colour seems much sexier than purple and black. Attached pics for the reference.

1.OLED Screen is good but by default its much of a warmer tone.You can disable the True tone option.Dark mode is lit 🔥🔥
2.Battery 🔋 lasts a day with Wifi ,location and Mobile Data on. Go..."
326,"I bought this iphone 12 in big billion days and saved alot thank you so much Flipkart for this amazing deal. The phone is great and has perfect camera, security and performance is ver good of this phone. No lack at all.
Battery backup is good you can spend a single day without charging it.
Size is perfect as iPhone 11 has same screen size but diffcult to carry but this device is light and perfect in size.
I give 4 star because they don’t other accessories now with iPhone."

330,Osm camera and super performance 😍
331,Camera is awsm nd functioning is smooth😀happy with my new phone
332,"The real smart phone in the market.....
Lets talk about it.....

Camera: In this range two best camera in the market are pixel 7 and s22. Portarit blur is more perfect in s22 but pixel 7 is real smart in image processing. This camera doesn't have manual mode so i was lil concern but when i started i never felt any need. Oh my god the night mode is just awesome.
A few cons of camera are 1. Wide angle is not that wide and edge detection in portrait is not good. Cinematic blur is a beta feature..."
333,Night mode and Indoor clicks are awesome
334,"After 1month of usage ---Best performance with very smooth UI . Battery comes to 30% by 5pm if you charge at 9am (Differ with usage). Camera is at its best but still it should get some updates for edge detection in portraits. Zoom quality is okay not that great.

Apart from camera -Design, compactness, UI , 90hz are huge plus... Feels really smooth and lovable for stock Android fans."
335,"No words, simply superb camera and overall, very rich and smart. Just buy, no need to think twice."
336,Excellent phone from Google..camera quality and number of photography modes are amazing... battery performance could have been better..misses out on a telephoto lens available in pro version...overall as a daily driver no issues as of now...Hope feature drops keep the brilliance going over the years!!
337,"Perfect phone, one star less because of its weight."
338,"Loved the phone. Just capture any photo, let Google do the processing and then see the magic 🪄 happen.
The only thing I didn't like is the time it takes to charge the battery. At this age every brand should give a minimum support of 45 w charging. Also we haven't received a free vpn from Google one yet."
339,"Writing this review after almost a month of use
Amazing cameras, Excellent performance, Great display, haven't seen any bugs in OS yet, great design
Was having a heating issue initially, temprature used to goes upto 43 Celcius. I was worried and was thinking to replace. But after a week of use everything went to normal haven't faced heating problem afterwards. Maybe because of optimization. Same goes for battery performance. Initially I was getting 4 to 4.5 hour of screen on time. But after w..."
340,"Its an excellent product from Google, i switched from Apple after using Apple phone since iPhone 3gs Days. I would recommend Pixel 7 if you are looking for pure Android, Quality at affordable price!"
341,This is the best Pixel phone ever. Camera easily beats the iPhone14. Go for the best stock Android experience.
342,"1. Main Camera - Amazing !! If you are looking for the best camera phone under 40k, go for it.... Far better than those blurry iphone photos....Night mode is out of the world.... Best in class... But no 50mp photo... Felt very helpless for that....
2. Wide angle camera - Not that wide, but clear and visible details comes from this camera, with good amount of low light capability.
3. Performance - For day to day task, it is more than enough... For casual gaming also, it is very good, but not f..."
343,"Camera performance and picture quality is superb but the different modes take significant time to change. So, software needs to be optimised.
Phone heats up during charging and using camera Charging is super slow..like 1.5 to 2 hours at this age.. Really disappointed with it."
344,"PIXEL 7

The phone is lovely. Hands on feel is good.
Camera: Its great. Video stabilization at 4k 60 fps is good, and smooth. It cannot beat Iphone though, regarding color tonality and sometimes dynamics as well, myself having switched from iPhone 11. Even then, camera specs would stand next to iPhone.
Battery: The battery life is good, good enough to last 11+ hrs with moderate usage.
Display: The oled display is good.
Charging: I have purchased 20w pd charger from Dr. Vaku, it charges faster..."
345,"The pixel 7 first impression - value for money.
Rear camera is awesome.
Front camera has a little less quality.
The photo becomes over saturated after processing.
Performance is smooth and reliable.
Battery is good.
Has a little heating issue after heavy processing and prolonged heavy usage.
Requires PD usb-c 30w adaptor for faster charging.
Comfort to hold after installing case.
Has a premium feel.
The live translate,magic eraser,unblur are unique and wonderful."
346,"Switched from samsung S10 lite
Better battery and camera than S10 lite
Performance is okay
I felt mobile is too small than old mobile
Looks great and pretty heavy
I have attached day and night picture"

348,Great phone good value for money
349,"Phone is slippery... Camera is awesome.. performance is good.. processor not fast as snapdragon.. battery backup good.. but charging is main problem u don't know which capacity charger is compatible.. using 20w flesh charger. And 65w wrap charger but performance is same.1hr for 70%.. dynamic range, low light, true colours, camera function is best."
350,"This is my first pixel experience. Managed to buy it at the best price on the day of launch without any reviews or unboxing. I have used the device for 12hrs now, so here's my review so far.

Camera - 5/5
The best camera on an Android, can easily beat samsung and regular iphone models. Many software modes in camera are just amazing. The video recording experience is also very good.

Build and feel- 5/5
The build is the best at this price range with gorilla glass victus both at front and back ..."
351,"The in-hand feel was awesome. It has the best camera and night mode was superb. The image processing was too good, no other brand can beat it. Using this mobile since 1 month, I didn't get any issues. Loved the camera and unique design"
